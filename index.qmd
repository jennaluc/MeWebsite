## About me :=)

### Background
My name is Jenna Kim Luc. I was born in Virginia, where I formed core memories of jumping in piles of leaves in the fall and making snow angels in the winter. My family then moved to Southern California where I was raised and attended all of my schooling. With my parents, sister, and pets, I grew up camping, fishing, shopping, and eating in SoCal (arguably the best place in the US). I am now in the beautiful state of Hawaiʻi for the final boss level of school: PhD. 

### Five Fun Facts (about me)

1. I am half Korean and half Vietnamese. With my parents and food being my strongest cultural ties. 
2. Spanish is second best language I know (behind English). 
3. I am in my 19th year of school. I have my bachelor's and master's degrees, and am now working toward my doctorate in microbiology.
4. I prefer matcha over coffee, but seek energy drinks for necessary bouts of caffeine. 
5. I am a foodie. I love everything about food - sharing a meal, trying new recipes, experiencing nostalgia through food, all of the above.

### Research interest
I have always been fascinated about how 'little guys' that we can't even see have such a profound impact on everything around us. Dutch microbiologist, Baas Becking, came up with a hypothesis that has stuck with me: 
**"Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects."**

For my Master's thesis work, in the laboratory of Dr. Catherine Schrankel, I explored the microbial origins of black spot disease in sea urchin *Lytechinus pictus*. 

Now in my PhD, I am interested in host-pathogen interactions, particularly with the pathogens *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and *Mycobacterium marinum*. In the lab of Dr. Sladjana Prišić, I am investigating *M. marinum* infection to zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) to further understand mycobacterial virulence.  

### What I hope to learn
From this course, I hope to gain confidence in coding and learn to make nice, publication-worthy figures. In school, I hope to learn about and how to do **good science**.
