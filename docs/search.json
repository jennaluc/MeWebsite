    "text": "About me :=)\n\nBackground\nMy name is Jenna Kim Luc. I was born in Virginia, where I formed core memories of jumping in piles of leaves in the fall and making snow angels in the winter. My family then moved to Southern California where I was raised and attended all of my schooling. With my parents, sister, and pets, I grew up camping, fishing, shopping, and eating in SoCal (arguably the best place in the US). I am now in the beautiful state of Hawaiʻi for the final boss level of school: PhD.\n\n\nFive Fun Facts (about me)\n\nI am half Korean and half Vietnamese. With my parents and food being my strongest cultural ties.\nSpanish is second best language I know (behind English).\nI am in my 19th year of school. I have my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, and am now working toward my doctorate in microbiology.\nI prefer matcha over coffee, but seek energy drinks for necessary bouts of caffeine.\nI am a foodie. I love everything about food - sharing a meal, trying new recipes, experiencing nostalgia through food, all of the above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOatmilk matcha with strawberry …yum!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarlic herb rolls :D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nBachelor of Science in Biology, University of California - Riverside\nMaster of Science in Microbiology, San Diego State University\nDoctor of Philosophy in Microbiology, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa\n\n\n\nResearch interest\nI have always been fascinated about how ‘little guys’ that we can’t even see have such a profound impact on everything around us. Dutch microbiologist, Baas Becking, came up with a hypothesis that has stuck with me: “Everything is everywhere, but the environment selects.”\nFor my Master’s thesis work, in the laboratory of Dr. Catherine Schrankel, I explored the microbial origins of black spot disease in sea urchin Lytechinus pictus.\nNow in my PhD, I am interested in host-pathogen interactions, particularly with the pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum. In the lab of Dr. Sladjana Prišić, I am investigating M. marinum infection to zebrafish (Danio rerio) to further understand mycobacterial virulence.\n\n\nWhat I hope to learn\nFrom this course, I hope to gain confidence in coding and learn to make nice, publication-worthy figures. In school, I hope to learn about and how to do good science.\n\n\nLink to a cool website\n\nhttps://theloopywhisk.com\nThis website holds baking recipes written by an inorganic chemist PhD holder, Katarina Cermelj. These recipes can be customized to be gluten free, dairy free, egg free, vegan, and / or gluten free-vegan! As someone that has dietary restrictions and allergies, The Loopy Whisk recipes allow me to bake fun treats without compromising my health too much."
